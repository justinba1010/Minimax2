# Minimax2
An updated more comprehensive version of my previous Minimax AI, this time with a full design and full polymorphism with all the games.
My last go at it, was rushed and I feel that I did not lay it out entirely.
This time I want to truly be able to play every game without messing with the unicode and Move function and class respectively.

# Goal
The main goal is that I have a good enough design that I can write a new Board object with an actual library and use my object to coordinate the interactions with the library. So it will be able to play an optimized Chess Board that should ultimately reduce complexity of I believe somewhere in O(n^4) and O(n^6) and bring it down to a faster AI.
This was one reason I chose Java over Python, because alas I have all semester to finish this and no deadlines.

# Changing Games
The idea is that all you have to do is load a new Board.java and Move.java file and you should have a fully functioning AI that plays the new Game.
